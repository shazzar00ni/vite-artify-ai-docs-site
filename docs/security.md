# Security Policy

Last updated: 23/12/2024

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. To report a security issue, please open a security advisory with a detailed description of the issue, steps to reproduce, affected versions, and if known, mitigations.

2. Please include everything required to reproduce the issue, including a publicly accessible git repository and/or StackBlitz repository.

3. All code samples shared with our Security team will only be used to verify and diagnose the issue and will not be publicly shared with anyone outside of Artify-AI's teams.

4. Security Team members may share information only within the Artify teams on a need-to-know basis to fix the related issue.

5. Our Security team will respond to the security advisory within three working days.

> If you think you've found a security issue, please DO NOT report, discuss, or describe it on Discord, GitHub, or any other public forum without prior contact and acknowledgment of Artify's Security team.

> This project follows a 90-day disclosure timeline. This is detrimental to the safety of all Artify-AI users. There are no exceptions to this rule.
